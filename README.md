# InFlight Taxi Timer

### [Download Latest](https://github.com/fondlez/InFlight-Taxi-Timer/releases/latest)

This is a variant of the InFlight Taxi Timer addon for the World of Warcraft 
game, Mists of Pandaria expansion (5.4.8 client).
It contains fixes for event bugs, particularly the flight timer failing to end 
when a flight lands.

* Original addon is by [TotalPackage](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info11178-InFlight.html).

## Description
InFlight is a simple taxi flight timer mod that lets you know how long it will 
take to get to your destination. Other mods may provide a similar feature, 
however, InFlight is a lightweight alternative that, in most cases, is leaner, 
faster and uses a lot less memory (which is the main motivation behind 
InFlight).
